# Fuel Prediction Using Multilinear Regression ðŸš—â›½

## Overview
This project predicts fuel consumption based on various factors using a Multilinear Regression model. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict fuel-related metrics effectively.

## Features
- Implements Multilinear Regression for predictive modeling.
- Handles real-world data with preprocessing.
- Includes model training, evaluation, and saving for future use.
- Provides a pickle file for deploying the trained model.

## Project Files
- **`fuel_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **`model.pkl`**: Serialized pickle file of the trained model for deployment.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
